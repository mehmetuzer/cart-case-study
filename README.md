## Building a Project

Build any .NET Core sample using the .NET Core CLI, which is installed with [the .NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download). Then run
these commands from the CLI in the directory of any sample:

```console
dotnet build
dotnet test
dotnet run
```

These will install any needed dependencies, build the project, and run
the project respectively.
